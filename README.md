This project enables the integration of Veeam Backup with the Visual TOM scheduler.

Two solutions are provided here:

Solution 1: Windows-only integration based on PowerShell commands

Solution 2: Generic Windows/Linux integration to execute jobs on Veeam agents

Two Python scripts are used together with their associated queue wrappers:

Windows integration: veeam_wnt.py with submit_queue_veeam_wnt.bat

Windows/Linux integration: veeam.py with submit_queue_veeam.bat (Windows) or tom_submit.veeam (Linux)

# Prerequisites

  * Visual TOM 7.1.2 or higher
  * Windows with PowerShell installed
  * Python 3.x or higher
  * Veeam.Backup.PowerShell module installed and accessible

# Instructions
Solution 1: Veeam Backup (Windows-only)
The script calls Veeam PowerShell commands from Python using subprocess. It supports the following actions:
  * Start a job (incremental or full)
  * Stop a job
  * Enable / disable a job
  * Check the status of a job

Solution 2: Multi-platform (Windows/Linux) â€“ Veeam Agent + Veeam Config Tool (veeamconfig)
Veeam Agent (Windows/Linux): allows backups locally, to network shares, or to Veeam repositories.
 - veeamconfig (Linux)
 - Veeam.Agent.Configurator.exe (Windows)

The script calls Veeam commands through Python using subprocess. It manages the following:
  * Start a job for backup
  * Check the status of jobs
  * List available jobs

# Usage Guidelines

The application model should be imported depending on the chosen solution (1/2).
The Visual TOM job must be executed either from the Veeam server (Solution 1) or from a Veeam agent (Solution 2).

Notes:
The Python script veeam_wnt.py uses generic variables.
The script veeam.py requires specifying the installation path of Veeam commands for the Windows part: Veeam.Agent.Configurator.exe.

Tests with Solution 1
Direct execution (Python only)
  ``` Python
python veeam_wnt.py "JobName" --start
python veeam_wnt.py "JobName" --status
python veeam_wnt.py --list
  ```
 
  ```Execution via queue
queue_veeam_wnt.bat JobName START FULL
queue_veeam_wnt.bat JobName START INCR
queue_veeam_wnt.bat JobName STOP
queue_veeam_wnt.bat JobName ENABLE
queue_veeam_wnt.bat JobName DISABLE
queue_veeam_wnt.bat JobName STATUS
  ```
